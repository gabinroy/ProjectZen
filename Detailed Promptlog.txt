you will build a minimal project management web application using only AI-generated code via prompt engineering. Core capabilities must be fully prompt-driven.

ðŸ“Œ Step 1: Authentication & Authorization Prompt the AI to scaffold user sign-up, sign-in, and role-based access (Admin, Manager, Team Member).

ðŸ“Œ Step 2: Project & Task Boards Generate Kanban-style boards, task creation forms, drag-and-drop columns, and task detail views using prompt instructions.

ðŸ“Œ Step 3: Notifications Implement in-app alerts for task assignments and upcoming due dates.

ðŸ“Œ Step 4: Progress Dashboard Create charts and visualizations to track project and task status using AI-generated code.

ðŸ“Œ Step 5: File Attachment & Comments Enable file uploads to tasks and support threaded comments through prompt-based development.

OK, here's a plan for how we'll prototype this app. Take a look below and customize as needed, or if you're ready, select Prototype this App.

App Blueprint
User Authentication & Authorization â€” Basic user sign-up/sign-in functionality with distinct user roles (Admin, Manager, Team Member) managed via environment variables, roles will restrict some functionalities.
Project & Task Boards â€” Kanban-style boards for project and task management with drag-and-drop functionality for task status updates.
Notifications â€” In-app alerts for task assignments and approaching due dates. Limited to UI alerts; no external notifications (email, SMS).
Progress Dashboard â€” Dashboard providing a summary of project and task status using simple charts. This is mostly UI functionality; data is mocked or managed in the UI's state.
File Attachment & Comments â€” Ability to attach files to tasks; limited to local storage, with support for threaded comments. Functionality managed primarily on the front end.
AI Comment summarization
 â€” A tool to auto-summarize the user comments on each task. An LLM reasons over user input, in order to distill comments down to the central idea or important actions
Color
Layout
Clean, card-based layouts to emphasize organization and clarity.
Typography
Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif for clean, modern readability.
Iconography
Minimalist icons to represent task status, user roles, and other project elements.
Animation
Subtle transitions to indicate changes in task status and navigation, enhancing user experience.
AI
Gemini, Genkit
UI
TypeScript, NextJS, Tailwind CSS

For login, password is must. In the database, can you update the email with corresponding password with assigned role. Also give me a table with email password & role

Gemini
Of course. I'll update the login to require a password and add passwords to your user data. Here are the changes.

I have updated the login functionality to require a password. I've also added passwords to the user data and will no longer log in a user based only on their role. Here is the user data with passwords:

| Email | Password | Role | | :--- | :--- | :--- | | alex@example.com | password-admin | Admin | | jane@example.com | password-manager | Manager | | sam@example.com | password-member | Team Member | | casey@example.com | password-member2 | Team Member |

Can you tell me what role is assigned as default for new (signup) personals

Gemini
Upon signing up, new users are not assigned a default role. The current implementation for signup is a placeholder.

Would you like me to implement user creation and assign 'Team Member' as the default role for new users?



G Abin
Yes PLease. Also add an option to admin to change existing roles

Gemini
Sounds like a great plan. I'll implement the new sign-up functionality and add a user management page for admins. Here are the changes.

Can you make a change that the admin can add new projects and assign a manager. The manager can add team member. Admin can also add team memeber if they wish

Gemini
Of course. I can add the ability for Admins to create projects and for both Admins and Managers to manage team members on those projects. Here are the changes I'll make.

Restore
I've implemented the requested features. Now, Admins can create new projects and assign a Manager from the projects page. Once inside a project, both Admins and the designated Manager can add or remove team members.



G Abin
Try fixing this error: Build Error: Module not found: Can't resolve '@/co...

Gemini
It looks like the Command component, which is used for the search functionality when adding team members, is missing. I'll add the necessary file for the command component and update your package.json to include a required dependency.

This should resolve the build error. Let me know if you run into any other issues!



G Abin
On login page in email, please remove the demo text

Gemini
Of course. I'll remove the pre-filled email address from the login form to clear out the demo text. Here are the changes.

c84e835
I've removed the default email from the login form. The field will now be empty when the page loads.



G Abin
Can you give a zip file with the whole code of this project

Gemini
I'm sorry, but I can't provide a zip file of the project. My capabilities are focused on helping you build and modify the application by editing the code directly within this environment.

All the files that make up your project are visible in the file explorer on the left side of your screen. You can review and copy the code from there if you need to.

Can you make a small change that for each project, the admin, manager and team member can create tasks for the project.

Gemini
Of course. I will add the ability for any project member (Admin, Manager, or Team Member) to create new tasks within a project. Here are the changes.

6863ab9

Restore
I've added an "Add Task" button to the "To Do" column on the project board. Clicking it will open a dialog where any project member can fill in task details, set a priority and due date, and assign it to other project members. This should make it much easier to add tasks on the fly.



G Abin
Make sure that Project Admin is member of all projects . and atleast on emanager in each project

Gemini
Of course. I'll update the project creation logic to automatically include the Admin in every project, and I'll ensure every project has at least one Manager assigned.

Now, all projects will have at least one manager assigned, and the admin will automatically be a member of every project.



G Abin
Can you check and make sure that all the following features are there in the project

Authentication & Authorization Prompt the AI to scaffold user sign-up, sign-in, and role-based access (Admin, Manager, Team Member).

roject & Task Boards Generate Kanban-style boards, task creation forms, drag-and-drop columns, and task detail views

Notifications Implement in-app alerts for task assignments and upcoming due dates.

Progress Dashboard Create charts and visualizations to track project and task status

File Attachment & Comments Enable file uploads to tasks and support threaded comments

If any features are missing, make sure to add that feature to the project

Gemini
Of course. I've reviewed your project against the feature list. Here's a summary of the status and the changes I'll make to implement the missing functionality:

Authentication & Authorization: Complete.
Project & Task Boards: Complete.
Progress Dashboard: Complete.
File Attachment & Comments: Complete.
Notifications: This feature is missing. The UI contains a placeholder for notifications, but there's no system to generate alerts for task assignments or upcoming due dates.
I will now implement the missing notifications feature. I'll add logic to create notifications when a user is assigned to a new task and also create notifications for tasks that are due soon. These will then appear in the notifications panel in the header.

Here are the changes:

Can you make a small change that for team members and manager, they can only view the projects they are assigned to

Gemini
What else can I help you with?



G Abin
Can you make a small change that for team members and manager, they can only view the projects they are assigned to

Gemini
Of course. I'll update the projects page to ensure that Managers and Team Members can only see the projects they are assigned to, while Admins retain full visibility. Here are the changes.

658ff2e

Restore
I've updated the logic to filter the projects based on user roles, so now the projects page will only show relevant projects to each user.

Try fixing this error: Console Error: A param property was accessed direc...

Gemini
Of course. I see that the component at src/app/projects/[id]/page.tsx is attempting to directly access params.id, which is causing the error you're seeing. This is a common issue when working with Next.js routing.

I'll update the component to correctly handle the params object. Here are the changes I'm making to fix this for you.

I've made the necessary changes to correctly access the project ID. This should resolve the error you were seeing.
